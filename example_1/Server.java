 * a screen name by sending the client the text "SUBMITNAME", and keeps
 * requesting a name until a unique one is received. After a client submits a
 * unique name, the server acknowledges with "NAMEACCEPTED". Then all messages
 * from that client will be broadcast to all other clients that have submitted a
 * unique screen name. The broadcast messages are prefixed with "MESSAGE".
 *
 * This is just a teaching example so it can be enhanced in many ways, e.g.,
 * better logging. Another is to accept a lot of fun commands, like Slack.
